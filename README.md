Diving Deep
This is the TL3's platformer project
Our Live demo is scheduled for <t:1675962000:F>.

Our game is a cave themed platformer which consists of reaching the bottom of a level to progress.

As of Feb 2, I'm not sure that there has been any progress on the development for the game.

Frankly, I've never used .md (markdown) files before, so I'm not sure how this stuff formats. I think it's like a richer .txt file
